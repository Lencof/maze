# maze
=====
using deep reinforcement learning to learn a very simple maze game
=====

Overview
------

This code follows the description of the Deep Q Learning algorithm described in Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning [2] and shows that this learning algorithm can be further used in playing maze games.

Installation Dependencies:
------
Python 2.7  
TensorFlow 0.7

How to Run?
------
git clone https://github.com/dorje/maze.git
cd maze
python playMaze.py
